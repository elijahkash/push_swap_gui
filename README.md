## How to use:

### Install

This is a simple python3 package already added to PyPI. Therefore, to use you do not need to "clone" it from github. Then just open terminal and run:

`> pip3 install push_swap_gui`

> In some cases this may fail. Then, for example on Ubuntu 20.04, exec `> sudo apt install python3-tk` and try again.

> If you have just started at school42 and have never encountered python and have difficulty installing the application, visit this page: https://github.com/elijahkash/push_swap_gui/wiki/FAQ_for_beginners

### Launch

Now you can run this application from any directory, and in two ways:

- `> python3 -m push_swap_gui`
- `> push_swap_gui`

### Import

You also may `import push_swap_gui` as a module. In this case, you can:

- `push_swap_gui.PushSwapGUI(master)` : create a window with app in tkinter item, transmitted as `master`
- `push_swap_gui.push_swap(src_data)` : this func get iterable with source data, and return list with comands (push-swap solve)

Example:
```
>>> import push_swap_gui
>>> a = [1, -1, 3, 7, 2, 9, 12]
>>> push_swap_gui.push_swap(a)
['pb', 'ra', 'ra', 'ra', 'pb', 'ra', 'ra', 'ra', 'pa', 'pa', 'rra']
>>>
```
